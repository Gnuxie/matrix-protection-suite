// TODO: It would be nice to have a method on PolicyListRevision that would
// let us pass a membership revision and have it run the matches for us
// the idea being that it could use literal values from literal rooms
// to lookup memberships. Alternatively we could have a method that
// returns all literal rules or all glob rules so that this can be hand
// optimized. But it's a little silly that way since we would probably
// have to then make a temporary revision from glob rules just to make it
// easier.
// Whatever is chosen would need to allow the data to be partitioned

// TODO: Don't forget that when this is consumed by the user consequences capability
// that you need to do a check afterwards that the user didn't join more rooms
// while the capability was running, and if they did, keep removing them.
// however, doing so needs to consider the rooms that failed to remove e.g. because
// of permissions. can easily be done by comparing errors to remaining rooms.
// Worrying, it might be possible to evade a ban by joining rooms.
// Since the ban events have to take ages to come down sync before they get
// removed from the set revision, and if you join you can evade detection.
// So we might have to keep running the capability onMembershipChange when
// they join. Regardless of whether there are matching policies or not.
// Alternatively, we can just keep trying every time we get a join, which
// is probably going to cause a lot of duplicates unless we come up with
// something smart.
// Mutual excursion and checking repeatedly might not work because it takes
// time for the bans to come down sync and be processed. It might be possible
// to avoid that by keeping a small set of roomMembershipRevisionID's and successful
// room bans in a little list and simply compare and pop them off when we get
// the bans.
// To do this at the protection level we'd need to be aware of the difference
// between policies being recalled due to banning vs recalled because of removed
// policies. And that would need to happen in this revision. (Recalled vs no policies
// left and became absent)
