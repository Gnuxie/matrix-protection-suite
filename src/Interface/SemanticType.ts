/**
 * A semantic type is used to describe the expected behavior of a type beyond its shape.
 * At the moment invariants can be specified through the `Law` method.
 * This adds structure to important behavioural contracts that would otherwise be
 * placed loosely in unit tests with no organisation.
 *
 * Another important feature of the invariant law is that they describe why they
 * are included in the sematic type which helps negotiating their removal if
 * the underlying abstraction changes.
 *
 * Critically the laws as opposed to tests are also defined against the
 * interface and not any single concrete implementation. But all implementations
 * can test their implementation against the semantic type.
 *
 * This brings the benefits of test driven development directly to the stage
 * where the interface (and thus abstraction) is defined (or changed). Before
 * any concrete implementation is even considered.
