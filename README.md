## matrix-protection-suite

The matrix protection suite is a library that provides interfaces and models for
interacting with matrix policy lists. These models are not attached to any
single client backend.

The aim of the project is to extract components from [Draupnir](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/Draupnir) and [Mjolnir](https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir)
into a complete library that can be used in any application, from other bots,
to widgets, and web apps.

Currently anything involving policy lists has a well fleshed interface,
and are less likely to change than other components while this library
matures.

This library was generated from a [template](https://github.com/alioguzhan/typescript-library-template).
